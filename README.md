What is this course about?

This course offers a deep dive into the fundamentals of creative software development in C++ / openFrameworks (oF) as well as an overview and history of computer graphics. A special focus will be placed on producing interactive artwork using 3D animation and computer vision beginning with the fundamentals of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. Students will learn about different computational techniques, mathematical and graphical principles, and interactive trigonometric principles will be taught to understand the core of physics simulations and design of complex systems using multiple forces to see how collective patterns can emerge from individual behavior. Some of these concepts include coordinate systems and geometric transforms; drawing routines, antialiasing, supersampling; 3D object representation, spatial data structures, constructive solid geometry; hidden-surface-removal algorithms, z-buffer, A-buffer; illumination and shading models, surface details, radiosity; achromatic light, color specification, colorimetry, different color models; graphics pipeline; animation, levels of detail. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of how to build creative and interactive software, from design to development and deployment. Students will complete homework assignments for each course meeting in the form of code "sketches." In addition, students will spend several weeks building and presenting both a midterm and final project, applying learned concepts to create their own creative computer programs.
