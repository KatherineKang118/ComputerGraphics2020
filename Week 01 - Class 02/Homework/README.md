MEDIART 206: Computer Graphics - openFrameworks
	
Fall Session 2 2020	 

Week 01 - Class 02

## Homework:

Review C++ Basics
- [C++ Language Basics](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html) 
- [ideone](https://ideone.com)

READ the following chapters of the ofBook:

 - [Graphics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html)
 - [OOPs!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html) <<< this is a deeper explanation of what we did in class
 - [How OF Works](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)

USE this knowledge to create a few experimental apps of your own:

1.    Create a simple animation using a class of your own design.  You can use the Ball class as a template for your code.  
    Play with color, shape, size, movement, speed, etc.  
          - the class you write should contain both an update() and a draw() function  
        - try to use a vector in your app to contain multiple copies of the class  

2.    **Try** to make an **interactive** application using the mouse or keyboard
    - for example, how would you create a new ball when the user clicks the mouse?
    - Hint: look through the other default functions in ofApp.cpp, especially ofApp::mouseReleased(), and ofApp::keyReleased()

3.     [Extra] Look through the example "math" or "graphics" apps that came with openFrameworks (inside examples/graphics or examples/math)  
    Choose one example app, and copy the code to a new app you create.  Now modify the code!  Experiment - try "breaking" the code.  Try making the app do something different in subtle or extreme ways.
