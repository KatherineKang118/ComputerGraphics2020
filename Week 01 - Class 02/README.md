Week 01 - Class 02

# Setup


## 1. Download openFrameworks

Go to [openFrameworks.cc/download](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) and download the OF version that matches your platform (Mac, Windows, or Linux).

Unzip this file. You'll see a folder like `of_v0.11.0_osx_release`, which contains everything you need to use openFrameworks. 

I recommend placing OF on your Desktop or Documents so it's easily accessible, i.e. `~/Desktop/of_v0.11.0_osx_release`.  You can also rename the folder to something nicer like `~/Desktop/openFrameworks` if you want.


## 2. Setup your IDE

Your IDE - "integrated development environment" - is where you will write and build your openFrameworks applications.

#### Mac OS:
Use **Xcode** as your IDE.  
[Follow these instructions](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/) on the openFrameworks website to get set up with Xcode.  

#### Windows:
You'll use **Visual Studio Community 2017**.  [Follow these instructions](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs/) to get set up.


## 3. Install Git

Git is the "version control" software we will use to keep track of our code, and share it with each other.  
We will be use Git on the command line (i.e. through Terminal on a Mac).

Here's how to install Git:

#### macOS:

Install Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com and the command line tool.


#### Windows:

Install Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com

OR

Download the installer from [the Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  This will install Git, as well as __Git Bash__, which you will use as your command line interface to control Git.


## 4. Clone this repository

Use Github Desktop to clone the class repository. This will be demonstrated in class.

OR

Now clone this repository:

https://github.com/benjaminbacon/ComputerGraphics2020.git

### Demonstration

We will demonstrate in class how to clone and where your files are on your computer.
