## Creative Grading

If it is a homework assignment, the assignment is graded 50% technical and 50% creative. Many of you have asked what is meant by creative. Below you can find what is defined as techical and creative. 

50% Technical

* Code is functional and uses programming techniques appropriately, eg. object orientated programming where functions and objects are used to avoid repetition. Interaction design is considered so that the code operates as intended in a way that supports the underlying concept of the project (eg. details such mouse clicks or key press interactions are well designed). Code is clearly commented, referenced and formatted.

50% Creativity (25% for each)

* Concept: Your response is inventive and you are exploring ideas and questions outside of the obvious and predictable. Your project may respond to historic ideas or practices of art or design, however exploring these questions or subject matter in new ways.

* Aesthetic: The project is visually/sonically well resolved. This does not necessarily mean that your work is beautiful, but it must show a careful consideration of aesthetic choices where close attention has been paid to details such as font choices, color palette and compositional rhythm. These elements relate to the concept and intention behind the work.

If the assignment is your midterm or final project then documentation is also considered. So the breakdown would be 25% for techical, 25% for concept, 25% for aesthetic and 25% for documentation.

* Well documented: The post describing your project is well written, in sophisticated grammatically correct English. Your documentation shows project research and includes references to influences and research materials. It also includes appropriate visual/sonic materials documenting your work such as screenshots, GIFS or video material. It should clearly explain the intention behind your work to a non-expert audience. It should also include a link to the code on  Github.
